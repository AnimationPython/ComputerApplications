# ComputerApplications
A repository for the code used in GENG0015 Computer Applications on the Engineering Foundation Year at University of Southampton

The dojo folders contain code written live by a student (supported by navigator, pair programming style), under my supervision. During the session I ask the driver (student at the machine connected to a projector) to to write code to perform certain tasks; it varies between telling them the exact thing to type to asking it in more descriptive terms as the class gets more experienced. Then at each stage I explain what's happened, so the rest of the class can learn from the code that is being written live.
